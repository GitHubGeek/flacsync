Recursively mirror a directory tree of FLAC audio files to AAC/OGG. Source
files can be filtered (by sub-directory, or full path) in order to limit the
files converted. The script will also attempt to retain all meta-data fields in
the output files.

At a Glance
===========

* Mirror directory tree of FLAC files audio files to AAC/OGG (re-encoded using
  NeroAacEnc?).
* Filter source tree using one or more sub-directory paths.
* By default, will only re-encode missing or out-of-date AAC/OGG files.
* Optionally deletes orphaned output files.
* Multi-threaded encoding ensures full CPU utilization.
* Supports transfer of FLAC meta-data including *title*, *artist*, *album*.
* Converts FLAC replaygain field to Apple iTunes Sound Check.
* Resizes and embeds album cover art JPEG files to destination files.

Usage Model
===========

* Hard disk space is cheap, but flash-based media players are still limited in
  capacity.
* Create a lossy encoded "mirror" of your music files for portability.
* Setup a daily cron job to always keep your FLAC and AAC/OGG files
  synchronized.
* Re-encode your FLAC library to different AAC/OGG bit-rates in one command.
